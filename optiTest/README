This is an approach to solve optimization problem of small wind turbine prelimenary design 

[WE ARE HERE]1. BEMT is implemented [testing DONE, validation phase...]
   [X]- most inner loop
   [X]- allowed for differential programming
   [X]- contains important assumptions and scientific formulations
   [ ]- implement tip-hub loss factor

2. Construction of BEMT for the whole blade containing multiple sections with different  geometric properties and airfoil profile

3. Formulation of optimization problem as a whole

4. incooperating basic structure analysis, accustic calculation as constraint 

5. Optimization programm test, validation needed 

6. Apply to chosen geometries, airfoils, optimizatin strategies
