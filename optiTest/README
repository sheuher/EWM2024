This is an approach to solve optimization problem of small wind turbine prelimenary design 

[WE ARE HERE]1. BEMT is implemented [testing DONE, validation phase...]
   [X]- implement BEMT solver wihtout correction in momentum theory regime in corrected coord system
   	- no limitm interpolation scheme 
   	- all formulations
   [X]- implement BEMT solver without correction in multi regime
   	- based on NING2020 implement Buhl continuous empirical regime and PB regime
   [ ]- implement loss factor F due to rotational aerodynamic
   	- Prandtl tip hub loss factor
   [ ]- implement Re correction to CL CD 
   
   note that only ./1DBEMTMultiSectionValidation2notebook.jl contains the latest correct implementation

2. Construction of BEMT for the whole blade containing multiple sections with different  geometric properties and airfoil profile

3. Formulation of optimization problem as a whole

4. incooperating basic structure analysis, accustic calculation as constraint 

5. Optimization programm test, validation needed 

6. Apply to chosen geometries, airfoils, optimizatin strategies
