This is an approach to solve optimization problem of small wind turbine prelimenary design 

[WE ARE HERE]1. Implementation of a "2D BEMT" solver
   [X]- implement BEMT solver wihtout correction in momentum theory regime in corrected coord system
   	- no limitm interpolation scheme 
   	- all formulations
   [X]- implement BEMT solver without correction in multi regime
   	- based on NING2020 implement Buhl continuous empirical regime and PB regime
   [ ]- implement loss factor F due to rotational aerodynamic
   	- Prandtl tip hub loss factor [Prandtl: Aerodynamic theory Springer 1935]
   [ ]- implement Re correction to CL CD 
   [~X]- test and validate with other solver (Qblade, CCblade)
   [ ]- a test case is needed, where changes can be tested again reliably
   
   additionally:
   [ ]- implement numerical integration methods of thrust, torque, and power
   [ ]- implement various dimensionless quantities (such as thrust coefficient, power coefficient, some other crazy long common used metrics found in Durand1935)
   
   note that only ./BEMTSingleSectiontest.jl contains the latest correct + almost validated implementation

2. Construct based on real application (geometry, profiles of our small windturbine), try to get close to given performance sheet 

3. Formulation of optimization problem as a whole

4. incooperating basic structure analysis, accustic calculation as constraint 

5. Optimization programm test, validation needed 

6. Apply to chosen geometries, airfoils, optimizatin strategies
